# Analyzation and improvement of moucha.org

This project corresponds to the "Modern Internet Technology" course at Czech Technical University in Prague. The objective of this project was to analyze and enhance the original structure, which can be found i the `original` folder, by incorporating new and modern internet approaches that were learned throughout the course.

The outcome of this project is a comprehensive report document(`report.pdf`) that encompasses both the analysis of the original structure and the proposed improvements. By leveraging Software-Defined Wide Area Network and Software-Defined Access technologies, we have defined a more transparent and automated network. This upgraded topology not only ensures enhanced safety but also simplifies the overall network architecture, addressing and resolving the issues and limitations present in the original setup.
